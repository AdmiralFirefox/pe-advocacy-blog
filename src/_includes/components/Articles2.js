        <h1>Benefits of Playing Laro ng Lahi</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>1) Heart and circulatory system:</strong> Regular exercise or
          playing healthy games makes the heart muscles stronger and more
          efficient. The heart-beats of an athlete do not increase appreciably
          even when doing something requiring physical exertion, and revert very
          soon to the normal rate afterwards. In contrast, even a little
          exertion sends the pulse rate of a sedentary individual rocketing up,
          and it takes time for the heart to settle down to its normal rate of
          beating. The blood vessels dilate during exercise, and so more blood
          reaches the muscles. It has been found that during vigorous or rapid
          exercise, the blood circulation in certain muscles and organs
          increases 25 to 30 times, thus supplying the muscles and organs with
          more oxygen and a larger number of red blood corpuscles.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>2) The respiratory system:</strong> Breathing becomes not only
          more rapid, but also deeper, thus making increased quantities of
          oxygen available.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>3) The musculature:</strong> Healthy Games strengthens the
          muscles, promotes their development and increases their efficiency.
          Stronger muscles lend better support to the joints.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>4) The skin:</strong> The pores of the skin open up during
          exercise. The result is a healthier skin, because of more efficient
          disposal of impurities and dirt.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>5) Temperature of the body:</strong> The temperature of the
          body rises during playing. This promotes the burning up of the toxic
          substances in the body.
