        <h1>Importance of Laro ng Lahi in the Modern Days</h1>
        <p>
          The importance of “Laro ng Lahi” in modern times is still very
          relevant to the youth who are playing on the streets of barangays and
          towns, it also keeps these games from being forgotten. "Laro ng lahi"
          is sort of like a cultural street legacy that most children in the
          Philippines have played at least once when they were young. These
          games keep the cultural values of the predecessors of this land alive,
          all the way back to the old times when the ancestors of the children
          roaming the streets playing these very games when the ground was still
          vibrant with green flora.
